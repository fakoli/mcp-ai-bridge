# MCP AI Bridge - Feature Development Plan

## Current Project Analysis

### Existing Features
- **Core AI Integration**: OpenAI (GPT models) and Google Gemini integration
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, API key validation, secure error handling
- **Logging**: Winston-based structured logging
- **Tools**: `ask_openai`, `ask_gemini`, `server_info`
- **Configuration**: Flexible env var and config file support

### Current Architecture
- Main server: `src/index.js`
- Modular components: logger, errors, validators, rateLimiter, constants
- Jest testing framework with coverage
- MCP SDK integration

## Gemini-Suggested Features

Based on consultation with Gemini 1.5 Flash, here are prioritized feature suggestions:

### High Priority Features

1. **Model Chaining/Pipelining**
   - Chain multiple API calls together
   - Use output from one model as input to another
   - Enable complex workflows leveraging different model strengths
   - **Value**: Sophisticated AI tasks beyond single model capabilities

2. **Response Comparison/Analysis**
   - Side-by-side comparison of multiple model responses
   - Highlight similarities and differences
   - Include metrics like response length, sentiment analysis
   - **Value**: Help users evaluate and choose best responses

3. **Cost Monitoring and Budgeting**
   - Track API costs per service and over time
   - Budget limits and alerts
   - Cost dashboard/reporting
   - **Value**: Essential for managing expenses across multiple paid APIs

### Medium Priority Features

4. **Caching Mechanism**
   - Store and reuse previous API responses for identical prompts
   - Reduce API calls and latency
   - **Value**: Improved performance and reduced costs

5. **Customizable Response Formatting**
   - Output format options (JSON, Markdown, plain text)
   - Field inclusion/exclusion controls
   - **Value**: Better integration with other systems

### Lower Priority Features

6. **Prompt Engineering Assistance**
   - Suggest keywords and prompt improvements
   - Provide prompt examples and variations
   - **Value**: Improve AI output quality through better prompts

7. **Plugin System**
   - Plugin architecture for extensibility
   - Custom modules and integrations
   - **Value**: Flexibility for evolving needs

## Implementation Phases
